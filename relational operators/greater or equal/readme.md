# Compare two numbers using '>=' (greater or equal to) relational operator.

## Explanation
Since 20 is greater than to 10, the expression is true, and we get true (1) as a result.
(remember: 1 = true, and 0 = false)
therefore we get 1 as a output.
If x = 10, and y = 20, then expression is false, as 10 is not greater or equal to 20. therefore we get false (0) as a result.
and we get 0 as a output.

But the important thing is that now we can also check if the value of variable is equal the second operand of the expression, which we can not do by using greater than operator.

Now lets say that x = 10 and y = 10. Now this time the expression is still true, because now '>=' operator checks if the value is equal to second operand of the expression.

## Output
1
