# Compare two numbers using '<=' (less or equal to) relational operator.

## Explanation
Since 10 is less than to 20, the expression is true, and we get true (1) as a result.
(remember: 1 = true, and 0 = false)
therefore we get 1 as a output.
If x = 20, and y = 10, then expression is false, as 20 is not less or equal to 10. therefore we get false (0) as a result.
and we get 0 as a output.

But the important thing is that now we can also check if the value of variable is equal the second operand of the expression, which we can not do by using less than operator.

Now lets say that x = 10 and y = 10. Now this time the expression is still true, because now '<=' operator checks if the value is equal to second operand of the expression.

## Output
1
