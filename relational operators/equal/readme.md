# Compare two numbers using '==' (equal to) relational operator.

## Explanation:
Since 20 is equal to 20, the expression is true, and we get true(1) as a result.
(remember: 1 = true, and 0 = false)
therefore we get 1 as a output.
If x = 10, and y = 20, then expression is false, as 10 is not equal to 20. therefore we get false (0) as a result.
and we get 0 as a output.

## Output
1
