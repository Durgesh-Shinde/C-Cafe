# Compare two numbers using '!=' (not equal) relational operator.

## Explanation:
Since x is not equal to y, the expression is true, and we get true (1) as a result.
(remember: 1 = true, and 0 = false)
therefore we get 1 as a output.
If x = 10, and y = 10, then expression is false, as x is equal to y. therefore we get false (0) as a result.
and we get 0 as a output.

## Output
1
