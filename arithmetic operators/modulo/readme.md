# Find remainder using '%' (modulo) arithmetic operator.

## Explanation
We can find remainder of division using '%' (modulo) arithmetic operator.
We have two variables 'x' and 'y'. x = 5 and y = 2. and we also have third variable 'ans' which as the name suggests will store our answer.
We start by declaring variables x, y, and 'ans' and then assign x = 5 and y = 2.
Then we store value of x % y into 'ans' by using the '%' arithmetic operator.

## Output:
