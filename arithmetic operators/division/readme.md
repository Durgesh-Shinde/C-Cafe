# Divide two numbers using '/' arithmetic operator.

## Explanation
We can do basic division of variables or numbers using '/' arithmetic

We start by declaring variables x, y, and 'ans' and then assign x = 10 and y = 2.
Then we store value of x / y into 'ans' by using the '/' arithmetic operator.


## Output:
